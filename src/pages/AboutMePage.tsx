          <h3>Who I am</h3>
          <div className="text">
            <p>
              Raised in Rio de Janeiro, my <span className="important">first contact</span> with the world of
              programming was at the Electronic Engineering course at Federal
              University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). After fall in love with it, I
              decided to change my undergraduate course to Computer Science, at
              Federal Fluminense University (UFF). <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I started to learn all the basics of the computer world and
              discovered front-end development, which I fell in love instantly.
              A lot of this comes from my passion to develop beautiful,
              accessible and useful user interfaces. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I've been studying and working with several front-end
              development tools, such as React and Flutter, seeking to improve
              myself every day.
